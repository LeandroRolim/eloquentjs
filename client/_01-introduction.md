The client library provides the familiar Eloquent API in javascript.
It handles building queries with fluent syntax, making HTTP requests
to the server, and interpreting the responses.

The complete source for the client-side library can be found on github as
[parsnick/eloquentjs-client](https://github.com/parsnick/eloquentjs-client).
