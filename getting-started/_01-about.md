*EloquentJs* brings your existing [Eloquent ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/eloquent) to the browser.
When you've already defined your models as part of a Laravel application, *EloquentJs* takes your existing
configuration and gives you access to your data from javascript via the same Eloquent API you already know.
