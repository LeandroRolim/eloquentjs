The *EloquentJs* javascript library can make HTTP requests to fetch and submit data
for your models, but that's only half the problem: the server still needs to interpret
the incoming query and return the appropriate data.

This is where the `parsnick/eloquentjs` PHP package comes in. Download with composer and add
the service provider, as per the [Getting Started](getting-started/#installation) guide.
